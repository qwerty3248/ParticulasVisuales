###-If you can and you want to take it directly from the system you can do this instead: pip install pyopengl matplotlib pyqt5 pandas --break-system-packages.
###-Show if you have all of this instalations you can do: python3 -m pip show pyopengl matplotlib pyqt5 pandas.

##What does the code do?
###My code only shows you in 3D particles charge from a CSV and the energy (normalized) that the particles have and where are they in the space.
